Humbly-Signaling
================

This code is designed to simulate the humbling signaling game. The global values before all of the functions are the inputs for the game, and can be edited in order to change the game conditions. 

Just run the program and the average strategies will be outputed.

The code is designed for Python 3.x but it should work with older versions as well. One change that will need to be made for versions of python without the new division operator, is to uncomment the from __future__ import division, which is one of the first lines at the top of the page. One this is done the code should work fine.
